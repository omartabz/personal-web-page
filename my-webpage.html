                <p>Johannesburg's Constitution Hill is a powerful place that fuses South Africa's harsh past with
                    its
                    hopeful future.
                    Once a notorious prison complex, it now houses the country's Constitutional Court, symbolizing
                    the
                    triumph of justice.
                    Exhibits within the old fort walls tell the stories of those incarcerated there, including
                    Nelson
                    Mandela,
                    while the court itself safeguards the hard-won human rights of all South Africans.</p>

                <p>Mandela House, also known as the Nelson Mandela National Museum, is a historic site in Soweto,
                    South Africa.
                    It's the modest brick house where Nelson Mandela lived from 1946 to 1962. Today, it's a museum
                    showcasing his life and fight against apartheid.
                    The house itself has some original furnishings and even bullet holes from past attacks.
                    Mandela House serves as a powerful symbol of Mandela's legacy and the struggle for equality in
                    South Africa.</p>

                    Africa,
                    was adopted in 1955. Today, the square is a national heritage site with an open-air
                    museum showcasing the Charter's creation.
                    While some descriptions mention it also having entertainment options, its historical
                    significance remains the top draw.</p>
